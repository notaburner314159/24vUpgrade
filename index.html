  <header>PRUSA MK2S UPGRADE</header>
    <p>The first step in upgrading my outdated 12v Prusa MK2s to 24v was, obviously, sourcing the 24v PSU. I accomplished this through a sacrificial, donor ender 3 I found for free on facebook marketplace.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The next step was to source the bed and, crucially, a 24v output, 12v input MOSFET.</p>

    <p>This MOSFET gets wired to the 12v control board, using the old 12v output, and switches on a 24v power source, providing the power needed for the bed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Obviously, the temperature of the bed is calibrated through the board, so it can trigger on and off repeatedly to maintain a constant temperature.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>After sourcing these parts, the next step was to test them all.</p>

    <p>Following this, I had to design and print mounts for all of my new stuff, the PSU and the MOSFET, while I waited for a steel mount to come in directly from Prusa.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The designing of the mounts were, as per usual, easier said than done. My first step was to measure out the MOSFET and design a backing for it, which went smoothly. The issue soon became one of planning, where exactly should the mount for it go?</p>
